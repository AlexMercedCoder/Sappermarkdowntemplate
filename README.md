# Sapper Markdown Blog Template by Alex Merced

- markdown files go in markdown folder
- src/mark/[markdown].svelte is the layout of individual blog post
- Header and Footer components control the overall theme of the page
- src/markdown.js controls data passed to each post, if you want to add data to all posts add it to the global object in that file.
